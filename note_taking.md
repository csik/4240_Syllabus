title: Note Taking

Welcome note takers! 

Thanks for volunteering to take notes in the next lecture. **You need to be in the lecture hall on that day to receive credit.** Note \[sic\] that note-taking is as much editing as it is transcribing, so only about half your work will be in lecture, the other half after. If you are doing the Tuesday lecture, the edited notes should be ready to distribute the following Friday at noon; if doing a Thursday lecture, due Monday at noon.

I'm leaving this process up to you because we're short staffed and I don't have time to interface with each team. Please read this carefully! I spend hours a day answering student questions, but I won't answer any about this extra credit process! I'm not mean, just busy. This is a courtesy to quarantined students because it's a lousy semester; it doesn't have to be perfect though you should do your best. If only 3 of you can do it, if the audio person has to be quarantined, please just do the best job you can!

The google doc you will be editing should be created in [this directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19Bp5ugJaC5VkiJ8kkT_W5uuvABNCiPdw)
and the file named with the lecture code as seen under the date in the course schedule, like: **LECTURE15**.
At the top of the page please put your netids and lecture code.

A reminder: three of you will be in charge of typed notes, one of recorded lecture, and the last of photographing and captioning. All are responsibe for editing: you should agree on how you'll wrap it up and finish it _before_ the lecture or just after.

You should probably take a lot of notes and photograph a lot, but remember that good lecture notes will NOT include every detail. They should be **edited** to carry major points, and certainly should not include, for example, the Professor's bad jokes or mistakes. 

Similarly, not every slide is of equal value, so it may make sense to drop slides if they don't argue for the major point of a section. An example: when I showed the "small platforms" in LECTURE14, the examples of oil/gas mining damage and the platforms we built around it could be condensed, while the (relatively short) point about Section 230 is the punch line, and should be emphasized. Use your judgement. 

For photography, the quality must be good, phone or camera should be fully charged, and a backup phone or camera (from another one of the team or a friend in lecture) should be ready as well in case of the unexpected.

For the audio capture, phone should be fully charged or plugged in at the lectern and recording 5min before the lecture; the app must be ready to use and reliable (test ahead of time), and the ultimate file should be trimmed and uploaded in WAV or MP3 format (or both). I can't give advice on the app; there are lots of them out there for all phone operating systems. Just make sure it won't crash or ask for payment halfway through lecture!

*NB: I know this will sound weird but I need to concentrate before lecture and go through about 20 steps to successfully project, so please don't ask me any questions! I'm really not kidding: the last time someone asked me a question as I was preparing my laptop battery ran out in the middle of lecture. If you have any questions ask a grad TA!*

When editing, please put photos inline next to appropriate text, scaled at page width. Finally, put the sound file -- also named after the lecture code but with the appropriate file extension -- in the same directory shared above. 

That's it! Remember: don't write me! You can figure this out on your own! The one bit of feedback that I ask is only if any of that week's volunteers didn't show up or contribute, then the others should note that on ED so that I won't give the extra credit. If everyone contributed, don't write anything!

Thanks for helping those who can't make it to lecture! Best of luck!
