The social impact of technologies is typically thought about fairly late, if ever, in the design process. Indeed, it can be difficult at design time to predict what effects technologies will have. Nevertheless, design decisions always "lock in" particular social values early on. In this course, we will draw on science & technology studies, technology design, and the arts to analyze the values embodied in technology design, and to design technologies to promote positive social impact. How can we "read" what social and cultural values technology designs consciously or unconsciously promote? To what degree can social impact be "written into" a technology? How can we take social and cultural values into account in design?

Technical background is not needed for this course, but may be drawn upon if you have it.

### Course Philosophy

Across the contemporary world, technologies are an intimate part of everyone's daily lives. The act of designing technologies does not simply create efficiencies or functionality; it also offers possibilities for (and constraints on) on our possibile actions, ways of looking at the world, and modes through which we can relate to one another. Designs thus, intentionally or not, embody values---ones we as a community of users sometimes accept, sometimes reject, sometimes build on, and sometimes alter.
