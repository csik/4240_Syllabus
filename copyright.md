## Disseminating course materials

**The teaching team owns copyright on all materials we produce**. We make as much available publically as we can in order to aid others teaching or taking similar courses. When we cannot make materials public - for example, because it might violate someone else's copyright - we provide them to course participants in print or through Canvas. These materialsÂ **should therefore not be provided to any third-party site**, even if your intention is to aid other students. To do so is a violation of our copyright. Please trust our judgement about what can be made public and what can't.

## Reusing material on this site

Other instructors from anywhere in the world are welcome to reuse materials, texts, assignment descriptions, policies, or anything else you find useful on this publically available webpage. You do not need to ask permission, although we appreciate hearing it if it's been useful to you!
