## Thursday 16 September: Persuasive Computing

Designing software and hardware to persuade people to alter their ways of thinking or their behavior, and thereby contribute to solving social problems.

### 1) Read before Class:

-   Fogg: [Persuasive computers: perspectives and research directions](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/274644.274677)

-   Consolvo et al.: [Designing for behavior change in everyday life](http://www.pensivepuffin.comwww.pensivepuffin.com/dwmcphd/papers/Consolvo.et.al.IEEEComputer.preprint.pdf)

-   Froehlich et al: [UbiGreen](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1518701.1518861)


#### Additional resources: Another useful how-to for persuasive technology: Fogg: [Creating persuasive technologies: An eight-step design process](https://doi.org/10.1145/1541948.1542005)

### Next Major Assignments Due:

-   Complete and upload your Design Workbook 1 by 10pm on 9/19.

-   Mini-Project due on 9/28 - pay attention in Friday (9/17) discussion and come prepared with a concrete behavior you will try to address for the in-class exercise. See [MP1 Instructions]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp1)  and the Guide to Persuasive Affordances below.

</td>
<td>
<p>People have different mental models of how thermostats work - some think of turning up the temperature as increasing the flow of heat, while others think of it as changing the temperature at which the furnace switches on or off. The latter model tends to lead to&nbsp; less energy use.&nbsp; Thermostats could be designed to more clearly evoke a "switch" model to reduce energy usage.</p>
