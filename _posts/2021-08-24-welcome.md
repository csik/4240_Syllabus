# Hey! You're in Designing Technology for Social Impact! That's great news!
We'd like to welcome you, on behalf of the entire teaching team. Like most of you, we're excited to be back in person, and we think you're going to enjoy the course. We look forward to seeing you in lecture on Thursday.

Before Thursday, please review the (syllabus)[https://courses.infosci.cornell.edu/info4240/2021fa]. If you have any questions, we'll cover them in lecture.

None of us know exactly what the semester has in store for us â€“ we live in interesting times. We are committed, though, to making this an enjoyable and exciting class. Let's savor the process of learning together as much as possible, while taking care of ourselves and others.
