## TODO for Thursday, Oct. 21 Participatory Design

Hey all, see Ed Discussion, this will be an online, virtual class this Thursday, Oct. 21.

Many of you will be overjoyed that you can watch from the comfort of you rooms; for those who prefer live lecture I apologize. To everyone, I apologize that there are parts of the video that refer to dates from last year -- I can't really edit those right now but PLEASE GO TO SECTION ON FRIDAY, it's very important and the timeline for the next miniproject will be revealed there.

Again, PLEASE GO TO SECTION ON FRIDAY as you'll find your PD partner there and who knows? You might might make a friend for life. But friend or no friend, you need a partner to finish MP3.
