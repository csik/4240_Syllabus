Here is a great overview on how to address accessibility in data visualizaion, in such a way that you make things more understandable for everybody. Some other useful tactics for designing compellingly persuasive information campaigns include the following: [Principle: Make the invisible visible](http://beautifultrouble.org/principle/make-the-invisible-visible/) (by Nadine Bloch) (Beautiful Trouble, pp 152-153); [Principle: Bring the issue home](http://beautifultrouble.org/principle/bring-the-issue-home/) (by Rae Abileah and Jodie Evans) (Beautiful Trouble, pp 106-107); and [Show, Don't Tell ](http://beautifultrouble.org/principle/show-dont-tell/)(by Doyle Canning, Patrick Reinsborough and Kevin Buckland) (Beautiful Trouble, pp 174-175)).
