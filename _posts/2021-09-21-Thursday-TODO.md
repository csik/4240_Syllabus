## Thursday 23 September: Political Games

Using game design to communicate political points of view

### 1) Read before Class:

-   Bogost: [Playing Politics: Videogames for Politics, Activism, and Advocacy](http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1617/1532)

## Next Major Assignment Due:

-   Mini-Project due on 9/26 - See [MP1 Instructions](https://courses.infosci.cornell.edu/info4240/2021fa/mp1)  and the [guide to persuasive affordances](https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/33335/pages/a-guide-to-persuasive-affordances), applying the processes practiced in section last Friday.

-   Design Workbook 2 due by 10pm on 10/3 - this is still a little bit in the future, but it is recommended that you think about designs as you do the unit's readings each week!

## Below is the rubric we use to grade Miniproject 1:

### Sketch 1

 + 0 pts
No design was included

 + 0.5 pts
The design is not persuasive

 + 1 pt
The design is persuasive, but does not use a persuasive affordance

 + 1.5 pts
The design uses an affordance, but which persuasive affordance used is unclear

 + 2 pts
The design uses a persuasive affordance, but there is inaccuracy in how the persuasive affordance is deployed

+ 3 pts
The design correctly uses the identified persuasive affordance

### Sketch 2

 + 0 pts
No design was included

 + 0.5 pts
The design is very similar to another included sketch.

 + 0.5 pts
The design is not persuasive

 + 1 pt
The design is persuasive, but does not use a persuasive affordance

 + 1.5 pts
The design uses an affordance, but which persuasive affordance used is unclear

+ 2 pts
The design uses a persuasive affordance, but there is inaccuracy in how the persuasive affordance is deployed

 + 3 pts
The design correctly uses the identified persuasive affordance

### Sketch 3

 + 0 pts
No design was included

 + 0.5 pts
The design is very similar to another included sketch

 + 0.5 pts
The design is not persuasive

 + 1 pt
The design is persuasive, but does not use a persuasive affordance

 + 1.5 pts
The design uses an affordance, but which persuasive affordance used is unclear

 + 2 pts
The design uses a persuasive affordance, but there is inaccuracy in how the persuasive affordance is deployed

+ 3 pts
The design correctly uses the identified persuasive affordance

### Behavior relation to issue

 + 0 pts
No behavior description was submitted

 + 0 pts
The behavior does not seem related to the social issue the assignment is about

 + 1 pt
The behavior is tangential to the social issue the assignment is about

+ 2 pts
The behavior is clearly related to the selected social issue

### Behavior is specific, measurable, and observable

 + 0 pts
No behavior description was submitted

 + 0.5 pts
The description is of an attitude rather than a behavior

 + 0.5 pts
The behavior is not specific, not measurable, and not objectively observable

+ 1.5 pts
The behavior is not very specific, but in principle it could be observed/measured

 + 1.5 pts
The behavior is specific, but it would be difficult to observe/measure it

 + 2.5 pts
The behavior is somewhat specific, measurable, and observable

 + 4 pts
The behavior is very precise: specific, measurable, and observable

### Connection between mechanism and behavior

 + 0 pts
The mechanism seems unrelated to encouraging the described behavior

 + 2 pts
 The mechanism might be related to encouraging the described behavior

 + 3.5 pts
The mechanism is loosely related to encouraging the described behavior

 + 4 pts
The mechanism is related to encouraging the behavior, but is not a computational technology 

 + 5.5 pts
The mechanism is clearly connected to the specified behavior, but may not be completely related.

 + 7 pts
The mechanism is clearly related to encouraging the specified behavior

+ 8 pts
The mechanism is likely to encourage the specified behavior 

### Compellingness

 + 0 pts
The mechanism would actively turn off the target audience

 + 2 pts
While the mechanism overall would not turn off the target audience, one or more aspects of the mechanism would turn them off

 + 3 pts
The mechanism does not turn off the audience, but lacks positive features to attract the target audience

+ 4 pts
The mechanism would be compelling to the target audience

### Robustness

 + 0 pts
The device is too complicated to use or requires too much overhead to be realistic in a real user's life

 + 1 pt
The device is usable, but requires users to significantly adapt their lives in order for it to work

+ 3 pts
The design requires some extra time and attention, but the load is reasonable in a regular users' life

 + 4 pts
The design will work effectively in a real personâ€™s life without special attention

### Persuasion vs coercion

 + 0 pts
The design is coercive

 + 1 pt
The design is coercive, but this could easily be fixed without changing the core mechanism

 + 2 pts
The design is persuasive, but there are aspects that are coercive

+ 4 pts
The design is persuasive, and not coercive

### Quality of design

+ 0 pts
The design is identical to one of the original sketches

 + 1 pt
The design is not original; extremely similar to a known real-world design (e.g., FitBit)

 + 1.5 pts
The design is very similar to one of the original sketches

 + 2 pts
The design is somewhat fleshed out from the original sketches, but does not significantly advance from them

+ 3.5 pts
Solid design along expectable/predictable lines

 + 5 pts
Design is truly creative and unexpected
