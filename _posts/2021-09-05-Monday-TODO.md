***For Tues 07 September: Responding to Readings Through Speculative Design***

We'll continue honing our skills at speculative design as a way to explore conceptual issues related to design.

Please do read (or re-read) the following two readings, as well as the Gaver & Martin "Alternatives" article, as we'll be doing in-lecture exercises around them.

Read before Class:

-   Pierce and Paulos: [Some variations on a counterfunctional digital camera](https://doi.org/10.1145/2598510.2602968)

-   Bleecker: "Part 1: Design Fiction"; pp 3-8 only of [Design Fiction: A short essay on design, science, fact, and fiction](http://drbfw5wfjlxon.cloudfront.net/writing/DesignFiction_WebEdition.pdf)

Additional Resources:

The concept of "lifeworlds" discussed in recent lectures was developed in this course by Vera Khovanskaya and Prof. Sengers. We got so excited about it we wrote [a paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376515) about it, together with Richmond Wong, an alumnus of 4240.

Next Major Assignment Due:

Complete and upload your Design Workbook 1 by 10pm on 9/19. More details on this assignment will come as we get closer to the deadline, but it is advised that you make one design for every day of pre-lecture readings.
