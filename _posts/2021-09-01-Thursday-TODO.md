**Additional resources:**
Note: these papers, like many on the syllabus, are available only if you are logged in on Cornell networks. An easy way to get access from off campus is to use the Cornell Library's [Passkey plug-in](https://www.library.cornell.edu/services/apps/passkey). Not feeling confident about sketching? For a great how-to, see Mike Rohde's [article on sketching as a design tool](http://alistapart.com/article/sketching-the-visual-thinking-power-tool). Another awesome paper describing design work drawing on speculative design is Gaver and Dunne: [Projected realities](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/302979.303168). For more on how we can think about designs as a form of conceptual reflection, see Bill Gaver and John Bowers. 2012.
