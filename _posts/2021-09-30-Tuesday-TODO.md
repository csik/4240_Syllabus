# Tuesday 05 October: The Politics of Algorithms 
How do political issues become embodied in the details of how computer programs work? How could they become embodied in new ways?

## Read before lecture:
- [Gillespie: The relevance of algorithms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Gillespie_2014_The-Relevance-of-Algorithms.pdf)
- [Smucker: Principle: Seek common ground](http://beautifultrouble.org/principle/seek-common-ground/)

## Please watch this video and take the quiz below it:

## Additional Resources:
An oldie but goodie - [Introna and Nissenbaum: Shaping the Web: Why the Politics of Search Engines Matter](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.library.cornell.edu/doi/pdf/10.1080/01972240050133634). This article explores the political consequences of search engine algorithms. It was the first landmark article to argue that search engines shape our political discourse, intentionally or unintentionally. While this article was written before the launch of Google (was there such a time?), its analysis is still relevant to search engines today.

## Next Major Assignments Due:
DW2 has been extended until 10/13. We will be discussing the context of [MP2](https://courses.infosci.cornell.edu/info4240/2021fa/mp2) (due 10/17) in lecture and discussion coming up!
