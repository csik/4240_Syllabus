How do IT developers in Silicon Valley frame how they are making a difference? What kind of a difference are they making?

**Additional resources:** Issues about Silicon Valley's take on how social change happens have been hitting the news a lot. See, for example, Arieff's [Solving all the wrong problems](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/opinion/sunday/solving-all-the-wrong-problems.html?_r=0). Another take on who tech developers and designers are supposed to be, and the ideas of change embodied in them can be found in Lilly Irani: [Hackathons and the Making of Entreprenuerial Citizenship](http://sth.sagepub.com/content/40/5/799.full.pdf+html).
