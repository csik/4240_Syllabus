Last week we started to review how values become integrated into a design. This week we'll start to learn about Speculative Design, an approach that allows us to expand the framing of a design's mandate. 

Additional resources: A classic reading on how to bring values into the design process along the lines suggested by Nissenbaum: Flanagan, M., Howe, D. and Nissenbaum, H. Embodying Values in Technology. In Information Technology and Moral Philosophy. Jeroen van den Hoven and John Weckert (eds.) Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 322-353.
