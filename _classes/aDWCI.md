This is a practice run. You'll create one single-page [design workbook](dw) in response to one of the readings due before this date (your choice!), and submit it to gradescope. 

You will be graded and receive feedback as if it were a regular assignment, but it's graded pass/fail, with any reasonable submission passing.
