title: "Design Workbook Check-In"
type: assignment
---
This is a practice run. You'll create one single-page [design workbook](https://courses.infosci.cornell.edu/info4240/2021fa/assignments.html) in response to the readings due before this date, and submit it to gradescope. 

You will be graded and receive feedback as if it were a regular assignment, but it will not count toward your grade.
